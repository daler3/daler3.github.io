						The New York City Department of Parks & Recreation has a vision to <i>"create and sustain thriving parks and 
						public spaces for New Yorkers"</i><a style="color: #bc184d" href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/about"><sup>1</sup></a>. Every 10 years, 
						volunteers and staff from NYC Parks & Recreation have collected information about street trees of NYC, starting from 
						1995. The collected data contains species, diameter, the percepted health of the tree and much more. 
						Using <a style="color: #bc184d" href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">NYC OpenData</a> containing the street tree datasets, this project 
						seeks to enlighten the interested readers into the topic of street trees in NYC, by mean of beautiful and interactive
						 visualizations.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
						The dataset that has been analyzed for this purpose is the <i>2015 Street Tree Census</i> data. As supplementary data, the 
						Street Tree Census from 1995 and 2005 have been analyzed as well. In the next section, it is possible to click different images
						 and hereby view different visual aspects of the Street Tree Census data. Here, you can view differences between the five 
						 boroughs of NYC: Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Manhattan, and Queens with regards to the most common trees, amount of trees,
						 area etc. It is also possible to view differences between the years 1995, 2005, and 2015, and to view details of the most common
						 trees. For a much more detailed and technical understanding of the project, the visualizations, and the methods used, please use
						 the download link available in the bottom of this section or go to the data set available at the
						 <a style="color: #bc184d" href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh"> OpenData NYC</a>.

                         For some parts of the project, we have also explored certain parts of the <a style="color: #bc184d" href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9">311 dataset</a>,
                         as well as the <a style="color: #bc184d" href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/ ">air pollution dataset</a>.
